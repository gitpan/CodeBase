CodeBase.pm
===========

CodeBase.pm is a Perl 5 module that provides access to XBASE files.
It requires the CodeBase library from Sequiter Software.

The current version of CodeBase.pm has been tested with CodeBase
version 5.1 and version 6.4 on Linux 2.2.  It should compile on other
Unix platforms, but I have no experience of compiling on Windows.


INSTALLATION 

First of all compile the CodeBase library according to Sequiter's
"Getting Started" guide.

Edit Makefile.PL and change the definitions of $cbincdir, $cblibdir
and $libcb if necessary to reflect the details of your CodeBase
installation.  The defaults (which reflect my installation) are:

    my $cbincdir = '/usr/local/include/codebase6.4';
    my $cblibdir = '/usr/local/lib';
    my $libcb = 'cb64';

(This assumes that the CodeBase library is installed in
/usr/local/lib/libcb64.a).

Having done this you can compile, test and install using the standard
Perl mantra:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
